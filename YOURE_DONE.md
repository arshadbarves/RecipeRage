## ⚙️ Configuration

### Change Timeout (for testing)
In `MatchmakingState.cs`:
```csharp
private const float SEARCH_TIMEOUT = 10f; // 10 seconds for testing
```

### Change Game Mode
In `LobbyTabComponent.cs`:
```csharp
// Classic 4v4
_stateManager.ChangeState(new MatchmakingState(GameMode.Classic, teamSize: 4));

// Time Attack 2v2
_stateManager.ChangeState(new MatchmakingState(GameMode.TimeAttack, teamSize: 2));
```

### Change Bot Names
In `BotManager.cs`:
```csharp
private static readonly string[] BotNames = new[]
{
    "Your Custom Name 1",
    "Your Custom Name 2",
    // Add more...
};
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: MatchmakingScreen doesn't show
**Check:**
- ✅ UXML file exists: `Assets/Resources/UI/Templates/Screens/MatchmakingTemplate.uxml`
- ✅ USS file exists: `Assets/Resources/UI/Styles/Screens/MatchmakingScreen.uss`
- ✅ UIScreenType.Matchmaking exists in enum
- ✅ MatchmakingScreen has [UIScreen] attribute

### Issue: Elements not found
**Check:**
- ✅ Element names match in UXML: `status-text`, `player-count`, `search-time`, `cancel-button`
- ✅ GetElement<T>() calls match element types

### Issue: Timeout doesn't work
**Check:**
- ✅ MatchmakingState.Update() is being called
- ✅ SEARCH_TIMEOUT is set correctly (default 60 seconds)
- ✅ Console shows timeout message

### Issue: Bots not created
**Check:**
- ✅ Console shows "Creating X bots to fill match"
- ✅ BotManager is initialized
- ✅ FillMatchWithBots() is called
