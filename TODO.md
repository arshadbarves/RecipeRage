## Critical Path Items (Immediate Focus)

1. Core Framework Completion
   - Complete scene management system
   - Finish state management implementation
   - Implement object pooling

2. Basic Gameplay Implementation
   - Basic kitchen mechanics
   - Simple recipe system
   - Player movement and interaction

3. Networking Foundation
   - EOS integration
   - Basic state synchronization
   - Room management

## Notes
- Priority should be given to core systems before feature implementation
- All systems should be designed with mobile performance in mind
- Regular performance profiling needed throughout development
- Unit tests should be written for all core systems

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining core framework components
2. Begin implementation of basic kitchen mechanics
3. Start EOS integration for networking
4. Implement basic UI framework

## Known Issues
- [ ] Performance optimization needed for object pooling
- [ ] Network latency handling needs improvement
- [ ] Mobile input system needs refinement
