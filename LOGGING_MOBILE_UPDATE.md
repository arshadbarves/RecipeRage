## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Console Not Opening on Mobile
**Problem**: 3-finger gesture doesn't work  
**Solutions**:
- Verify it's a Development Build
- Try 2 fingers instead of 3
- Reduce hold time to 0.5s
- Check DebugConsoleUI is in scene

### Gesture Conflicts with Gameplay
**Problem**: Gesture triggers during gameplay  
**Solutions**:
- Increase to 4 fingers
- Increase hold time to 1.5s
- Disable console during active gameplay
- Use button in pause menu instead

### Console Visible in Release Build

**Solutions**:
- Uncheck "Development Build" in Build Settings
- Verify `#if DEVELOPMENT_BUILD` directives
- Clean and rebuild
