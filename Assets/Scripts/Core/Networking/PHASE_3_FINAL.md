# Phase 3 FINAL: Complete Migration ✅

## Summary

**All old networking system code has been completely removed and migrated to the new architecture!**

## Files Deleted (4 total)

1. ✅ `RecipeRageNetworkManager.cs` - Replaced by NetworkingServiceContainer
2. ✅ `RecipeRageSessionManager.cs` - Not needed for P2P
3. ✅ `RecipeRageLobbyManager.cs` - Replaced by LobbyService
4. ✅ `RecipeRageP2PManager.cs` - Replaced by P2PService

## Files Migrated (3 total)

1. ✅ `MatchmakingState.cs` - Now uses NetworkingServices
2. ✅ `LobbyState.cs` - Now uses NetworkingServices
3. ✅ `MainMenuScreen.cs` - Now uses NetworkingServices
4. ✅ `NetworkMessageHandler.cs` - Now uses P2PService

## Migration Details

### MatchmakingState
**Before:**
```csharp
_networkManager = RecipeRageNetworkManager.Instance;
_lobbyManager = _networkManager?.LobbyManager;
_networkManager.CreateGame(...);
```

**After:**
```csharp
_networkingServices = GameBootstrap.Services.NetworkingServices;
_networkingServices.MatchmakingService.FindMatch(gameMode, teamSize);
```

### LobbyState
**Before:**
```csharp
RecipeRageNetworkManager networkManager = RecipeRageNetworkManager.Instance;
if (networkManager.IsHost && networkManager.AreAllPlayersReady())
```

**After:**
```csharp
var networking = GameBootstrap.Services.NetworkingServices;
if (networking.LobbyManager.IsMatchLobbyOwner && 
    networking.LobbyManager.AreAllPlayersReady())
```

### MainMenuScreen
**Before:**
```csharp
IMatchmakingService matchmakingService = 
    RecipeRageNetworkManager.Instance?.LobbyManager;
```

**After:**
```csharp
IMatchmakingService matchmakingService = 
    services.NetworkingServices?.MatchmakingService;
```

### NetworkMessageHandler
**Before:**
```csharp
_networkManager = RecipeRageNetworkManager.Instance;
_networkManager.P2PManager.SendPlayerAction(action);
_networkManager.P2PManager.OnPlayerActionReceived += HandlePlayerAction;
```

**After:**
```csharp
_networkingServices = GameBootstrap.Services.NetworkingServices;
_p2pService = _networkingServices.P2PService;
_p2pService.SendPlayerAction(action);
_p2pService.OnPlayerActionReceived += HandlePlayerAction;
```

## Code Quality

- ✅ **0 Compilation Errors**
- ✅ **0 References to Old System** (in code)
- ✅ **All Singletons Removed**
- ✅ **Proper Dependency Injection**
- ✅ **SOLID Principles Maintained**

## Architecture Benefits

### Before (Old System)
- ❌ Singleton pattern everywhere
- ❌ Tight coupling
- ❌ Hard to test
- ❌ MonoBehaviour dependencies
- ❌ No clear separation

### After (New System)
- ✅ Service container pattern
- ✅ Loose coupling via interfaces
- ✅ Easy to test
- ✅ No MonoBehaviour dependencies
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

## Remaining Tasks

### Scene Cleanup
The following scenes may have old GameObjects (can be safely removed):
- `Assets/Scenes/MainMenu.unity` - May have old manager GameObjects
- `Assets/Scenes/Game.unity` - May have old manager GameObjects

**Note:** These are just empty GameObjects now since the scripts are deleted. They can be removed from scenes.

### UI Components (Phase 4)
- [ ] Update `LobbyTabComponent` (if needed)
- [ ] Update `MatchmakingWidgetComponent` (if needed)
- [ ] Create Party Lobby UI
- [ ] Create Match Lobby UI

## Quick Reference

### Access Networking Services
```csharp
var networking = GameBootstrap.Services.NetworkingServices;
```

### Create Party Lobby
```csharp
var config = new LobbyConfig
{
    LobbyName = "My Party",
    MaxPlayers = 4,
    GameMode = GameMode.Classic
};
networking.LobbyManager.CreatePartyLobby(config);
```

### Start Matchmaking
```csharp
networking.MatchmakingService.FindMatch(GameMode.Classic, teamSize: 4);
```

### Send P2P Messages
```csharp
networking.P2PService.SendPlayerAction(action);
networking.P2PService.SendChatMessage(message);
```
