## Migration Summary

### MatchmakingState Migration

**Before:**
```csharp
// OLD - Using singletons
_networkManager = RecipeRageNetworkManager.Instance;
_lobbyManager = _networkManager?.LobbyManager;

_lobbyManager.OnLobbyUpdated += HandleLobbyUpdated;
_networkManager.OnGameStarted += HandleGameStarted;

_networkManager.CreateGame(sessionName, GameMode.Classic, "Kitchen", 4, false);
```

**After:**
```csharp
// NEW - Using service container
_networkingServices = GameBootstrap.Services.NetworkingServices;

_networkingServices.MatchmakingService.OnMatchFound += HandleMatchFound;
_networkingServices.MatchmakingService.OnMatchmakingFailed += HandleMatchmakingFailed;
_networkingServices.MatchmakingService.OnPlayersFound += HandlePlayersFound;

_networkingServices.MatchmakingService.FindMatch(GameMode.Classic, teamSize: 4);
```

### Key Improvements

1. **No More Singletons** ✅
   - All services accessed via `GameBootstrap.Services`
   - Proper dependency injection
   - Better testability

2. **Cleaner Event System** ✅
   - Specific events for each action
   - Better error handling
   - Progress updates during matchmaking

3. **PUBG-Style Flow** ✅
   - Party lobbies persist across matches
   - Match lobbies are temporary
   - Proper post-match flow

## Deprecation Warnings

Developers will now see warnings when using old classes:

```
Warning CS0618: 'RecipeRageLobbyManager' is obsolete: 
'Use GameBootstrap.Services.NetworkingServices instead. 
This class will be removed in a future version.'
```

This guides them to migrate to the new system.

## Files Modified

### Deleted
1. `RecipeRageNetworkManager.cs`
2. `RecipeRageSessionManager.cs`

### Updated
1. `MatchmakingState.cs` - Migrated to new services
2. `RecipeRageLobbyManager.cs` - Added deprecation warning
3. `RecipeRageP2PManager.cs` - Added deprecation warning

### Created
1. `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete migration documentation

## Remaining Work

### Scene GameObjects
The following scenes still have old manager GameObjects:
- `Assets/Scenes/MainMenu.unity` - Has `RecipeRageLobbyManager` GameObject
- `Assets/Scenes/Game.unity` - Has `RecipeRageLobbyManager` GameObject

**Action Required:**
- These GameObjects can be removed from scenes
- Functionality is now provided by `NetworkingServiceContainer`
- No MonoBehaviour components needed

### UI Components (Phase 4)
The following UI components need migration:
- [ ] `LobbyTabComponent.cs` - Update to use new services
- [ ] `MatchmakingWidgetComponent.cs` - Update to use new services
- [ ] Create Party Lobby UI screen
- [ ] Create Match Lobby UI screen

## Testing Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [x] MatchmakingState uses new services
- [x] No compilation errors
- [x] Deprecation warnings work
- [ ] Test matchmaking flow end-to-end
- [ ] Test party creation
- [ ] Test friend invites

### Migration Validation
- [x] Old singletons removed
- [x] New services integrated
- [x] Events properly wired
- [ ] UI components updated
- [ ] Scene GameObjects cleaned up

## Next Steps (Phase 4)

### 1. UI Integration
- [ ] Update `LobbyTabComponent` to use new services
- [ ] Update `MatchmakingWidgetComponent` to use new services
- [ ] Create Party Lobby UI screen
- [ ] Create Match Lobby UI screen
- [ ] Update friend invite flow

### 2. Scene Cleanup
- [ ] Remove `RecipeRageLobbyManager` from MainMenu scene
- [ ] Remove `RecipeRageLobbyManager` from Game scene
- [ ] Verify no other scenes use old managers

### 3. Final Testing
- [ ] Test with real EOS backend
- [ ] Test all matchmaking flows
- [ ] Test party + matchmaking
- [ ] Test P2P networking
- [ ] Test post-match return to party

### 4. Polish
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Add error messages
- [ ] Add retry logic
- [ ] Add timeout handling
- [ ] Add reconnection support
