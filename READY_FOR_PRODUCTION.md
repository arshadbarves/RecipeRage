## Troubleshooting

### Issue: MatchmakingScreen doesn't show
**Solution:** 
- Check UXML template exists at correct path
- Check UIScreenType.Matchmaking is in enum
- Check MatchmakingScreen is registered with [UIScreen] attribute

### Issue: Cancel button doesn't work
**Solution:**
- Check button name is "cancel-button" in UXML
- Check OnCancelClicked is subscribed in OnInitialize
- Check MatchmakingService.CancelMatchmaking() is called

### Issue: Timeout doesn't trigger
**Solution:**
- Check MatchmakingState.Update() is being called
- Check SEARCH_TIMEOUT constant (default 60 seconds)
- Check _hasFilledWithBots flag isn't stuck

### Issue: Bots not created
**Solution:**
- Check BotManager is initialized
- Check FillMatchWithBots() is called
- Check console for error messages

## Configuration

### Change Timeout Duration
In `MatchmakingState.cs`:
```csharp
private const float SEARCH_TIMEOUT = 60f; // Change to 30f for testing
```

### Change Game Mode
In `LobbyTabComponent.cs`:
```csharp
_stateManager.ChangeState(new MatchmakingState(GameMode.TimeAttack, teamSize: 2));
```

### Change Bot Names
In `BotManager.cs`:
```csharp
private static readonly string[] BotNames = new[]
{
    "Your Custom Name 1",
    "Your Custom Name 2",
    // Add more...
};
```

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Polish (1-2 hours)
1. Add animations (pulsing indicator, fade transitions)
2. Add sound effects (search start, match found)
3. Add player avatars/list
4. Add region/ping display

### Advanced Features (1-2 days)
1. Party matchmaking
2. Ranked matchmaking
3. Multiple game modes
4. Network reconnection
5. Analytics tracking

### Production Hardening (1 week)
1. Security measures
2. Anti-cheat
3. Rate limiting
4. Error handling
5. Monitoring
6. Localization
