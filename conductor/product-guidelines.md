## UI/UX & Tone Guidelines

### Tone of Voice
- **Primary:** Playful and Energetic.
- **Secondary:** Sleek and Professional.
- **Example:** "Let's get cooking!" combined with clear, efficient menus.

### Design Principles
- **Clarity over Complexity:** Easy to learn, difficult to master. UI must not obscure gameplay.
- **Fairness and Integrity:** Anti-cheat and synchronization are critical.
- **Modularity:** All features should be independent modules.

### UI/UX Styling
- **Aesthetic:** High tactility ("juicy" interactions), minimalist HUD, and skewed, dynamic layouts.
- **Reference Style:** "Skewed Shop" (Play Center) - Dark backgrounds, skewed cards (-10deg), dynamic hover effects, and distinct rarity borders.
- **Color Palette:**
    - Primary Red: #E63946
    - Accent Yellow: #FFD700
    - Backgrounds: Dark gradients (#1a1f2c to #050505)
    - Text: 'Anton' for headers, 'Montserrat' for body.
