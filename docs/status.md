# RecipeRage Development Status

## Project Overview
RecipeRage is a mobile multiplayer cooking game similar to Overcooked using Epic Online Services (EOS) for networking. The game features multiple game modes (Classic, Time Attack, Team Battle), character classes with unique abilities, lobby/matchmaking system, shop with currencies (coins/gems), power-ups, and monetization through ads and IAPs.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Core Framework Implementation (Phase 1)
- **Last Updated**: June 12, 2024
- **Decision**: Starting fresh implementation while using existing code as reference

## Completed Components
- Project documentation review and analysis
- Architecture planning and roadmap creation

## In Progress
- Project setup and organization
- Core framework implementation
- Game state management system

## Next Steps
- Player controller system
- Basic networking foundation with EOS
- Task system for recipes and orders
- Object interaction system
- Complete Core Framework (Phase 1)
- Implement Gameplay Systems (Phase 2)
- Develop Multiplayer Features (Phase 3)
- Create UI and Shop Systems (Phase 4)
- Integrate Monetization (Phase 5)
- Polish and Optimize (Phase 6)

## Issues & Blockers
- None currently

## Notes
- Starting with a clean implementation while referencing existing architecture
- Using ScriptableObjects for data-driven design (recipes, ingredients, etc.)
- Implementing modular systems with clear interfaces
- Following a component-based design pattern
- Focusing on mobile-first development with EOS integration
