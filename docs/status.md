# RecipeRage Development Status

## Project Overview
RecipeRage is a mobile multiplayer cooking game similar to Overcooked using Epic Online Services (EOS) for networking. The game features multiple game modes (Classic, Time Attack, Team Battle), character classes with unique abilities, lobby/matchmaking system, shop with currencies (coins/gems), power-ups, and monetization through ads and IAPs.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Core Framework Implementation (Phase 1)
- **Last Updated**: July 10, 2024
- **Decision**: Starting completely fresh implementation based on the architecture roadmap

## Completed Components
- Project documentation review and analysis
- Architecture planning and roadmap creation
- Preserved existing code in the prototype branch
- Created clean-start branch for fresh implementation
- Project cleanup and reorganization (removed old implementation code)
- Created directory structure for new implementation
- Implemented core patterns (Singleton, MonoBehaviourSingleton, ServiceLocator)
- Implemented state management system (StateMachine, GameState, GameStateManager)
- Created basic game states (LoadingState, MainMenuState, MatchmakingState, GameplayState)
- Implemented GameBootstrap for game initialization
- Implemented input management system with support for touch and keyboard input
- Implemented player controller system with movement and interaction capabilities
- Created interaction system with base classes for interactable objects

## In Progress
- Basic networking foundation with EOS

## Next Steps
- Task system for recipes and orders
- Object interaction system
- Complete Core Framework (Phase 1)
- Implement Gameplay Systems (Phase 2)
- Develop Multiplayer Features (Phase 3)
- Create UI and Shop Systems (Phase 4)
- Integrate Monetization (Phase 5)
- Polish and Optimize (Phase 6)

## Issues & Blockers
- None currently

## Notes
- Starting with a completely clean implementation
- Using ScriptableObjects for data-driven design (recipes, ingredients, etc.)
- Implementing modular systems with clear interfaces
- Following a component-based design pattern
- Focusing on mobile-first development with EOS integration
- Maintaining documentation throughout development
